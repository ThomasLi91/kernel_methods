All the personal code are in the src directory.

The data folder is empty, you need to put the kaggle dataset inside this folder to run the code.


Tried :
- ensembling
- preprocessing minmax scaling : better without minmax scaling + 0.01
- do data augmentation (flipping image, noise, hue and saturations augmentations, translations, cropping) : 55 -> 59
- hog features 24 -> 54
